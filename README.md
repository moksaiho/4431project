# 4431project
The aim of this project is to implement an extended version of the Kuwahara filter that uses circular sectors instead of square subregions. This approach can help to avoid the block structure of the output that is caused by the Gibbs phenomenon in the original Kuwahara filter. By using circular sectors, the filter can better adapt to curved edges and corners in an image. Additionally, Gaussian weighting can be used to further improve the quality of the output.

Functionalities / Features:
- Implement a circular sector-based Kuwahara filter algorithm
- Allow users to select different sizes and shapes of circular sectors
- Provide options for adjusting Gaussian weighting parameters
- Enable users to apply the filter to images in real-time
- Display filtered images side-by-side with original images for comparison purposes

Overall, this project aims to provide a user-friendly implementation of an advanced image filtering technique that can help enhance edges and corners in images with curved features.
